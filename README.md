# Resident Evil 3 Head Tracking

![Resident Evil 3 running with this mod](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsloopyo/resident-evil-3-headtracking/main/assets/readme-clip.gif)

An unofficial head tracking mod for Resident Evil 3 that moves the camera with your head while your mouse or controller keeps aiming, driven by OpenTrack over UDP, with no VR headset required.

> [!CAUTION]
> ## Experimental prototype - expect missing core features
>
> This is **not** a finished mod.
>
> Current builds may only test whether head tracking can drive the camera. Bug fixes and core features like decoupled look/aim, independent reticle behavior, correct shot direction, off-screen reticle support, movement handling, and comfort tuning may be missing at this early stage of development.

> **Updating from a dev build:** settings now live in `reframework\plugins\CameraUnlock.ini`. The first start of this version reads your settings from `HeadTracking.ini` into it, and never changes `HeadTracking.ini`. A sensitivity or axis inversion you changed is not carried over: set those in your tracker. See [Configuration](#configuration).

## Features

- **Decoupled look and aim** - head tracking moves the camera; aim stays on your mouse/controller
- **6DOF positional tracking** - lean and peek with head position
- **Works with any OpenTrack compatible tracker** - free options available for PC, iOS and Android

## Requirements

- [Resident Evil 3 Remake](https://store.steampowered.com/app/952060/Resident_Evil_3/) (Steam)
- [OpenTrack](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack) or a compatible head tracking app (smartphone, webcam, or dedicated hardware)
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)

## Installation

### Lopari

Once this mod is available in Lopari, download [Lopari](https://lopari.app), choose **Resident Evil 3**, and click
**Play with head tracking**.

### Standalone Installer

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/itsloopyo/resident-evil-3-headtracking/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP anywhere
3. Double-click `install.cmd`
4. The installer auto-detects your game and installs REFramework if needed
5. Configure OpenTrack to output UDP to `127.0.0.1:4242`
6. Launch the game. Head tracking is enabled automatically.

The installer automatically finds your game via Steam registry lookup. If it can't find the game:
- Set the `RE3_PATH` environment variable to your game folder, or
- Run from command prompt: `install.cmd "D:\Games\RE3"`

### Manual Installation

1. Install [REFramework](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework-nightly/releases) for RE3 (extract to game root)
2. Copy `RE3HeadTracking.dll` to `<game>/reframework/plugins/`. The mod creates `CameraUnlock.ini` beside it on first launch.

## Setting Up OpenTrack

The mod listens for OpenTrack pose data on UDP port `4242`, on every network
interface. One datagram is six little-endian 64-bit floats in the order
`x, y, z, yaw, pitch, roll`: position in centimetres, rotation in degrees, 48
bytes in total. Anything that sends that to that port drives the view.
OpenTrack's **UDP over network** output sends exactly this, and the steps below
set it up.

1. Install [OpenTrack](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/releases).
2. Pick a tracker under **Input**, using the notes below.
3. Set **Output** to **UDP over network**, host `127.0.0.1`, port `4242`.
4. Press **Start**. Tracking and the game can start in either order.

### Webcam

OpenTrack ships a `neuralnet tracker` input that reads a plain webcam. Select it
under **Input**, pick your camera in its settings, and use the output settings
above. How well it tracks depends on your camera and your lighting, so try it
before buying anything.

### Phone

A phone app can reach the mod directly, with no OpenTrack on the PC, if it sends
the datagram described above. Point it at this PC's IP address (run `ipconfig`
to find it) on port `4242`. Not every phone tracker speaks this protocol, so
check yours for an OpenTrack or UDP output option first. [Headcam](https://headcam.app)
sends it, and I wrote it so decent tracking is free for anyone who already owns
a phone.

Sending direct works when the app filters its own signal on the device. The
mod's smoothing is sized to take the edge off a clean signal rather than to
rescue a noisy one, so a raw feed sent direct will jitter. If it does, point the
app at OpenTrack's **UDP over network** *input* on some other port, say 5252,
and let OpenTrack's filters and curves clean it up before its output forwards to
`127.0.0.1:4242`.

Anything arriving from outside `127.0.0.0/8` counts as a remote connection and
is smoothed with `RemoteSmoothing` rather than `LocalSmoothing`. That includes a
tracker on this very PC that sends to the machine's own LAN address, because the
mod reads the source address and not the machine.

### Headset or other hardware

If your device has an OpenTrack input driver, select it under **Input** and use
the same output settings. OpenTrack's own **Input** list is the authority on
what it can read; the mod only ever sees what OpenTrack sends.

### Centring

Centring belongs to your tracker. The mod subtracts no centre of its own: it
applies the pose it receives exactly as it arrives, so a stream of zeros holds
the view where the game itself puts it. Press the centre control in your tracker
(OpenTrack's **Center** bind, or the CENTER button in Headcam) and the tracker
zeroes its own output, which leaves the view centred with the mod doing nothing.

That is why there is no centre hotkey here and nothing to re-centre in game. Two
centres in series would drift apart, because each side re-centres at moments the
other cannot see, and you would end up pressing twice to centre once. If the
view sits off to one side, centre it in the tracker.

## Controls

Two equivalent binding sets - use whichever your keyboard has. These are the defaults: each
action's keys are a list under `[Hotkeys]` in `CameraUnlock.ini`, chords included, and any of them
can be changed or removed.

| Action                     | Nav-cluster | Chord          |
|----------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Toggle tracking            | `End`       | `Ctrl+Shift+Y` |
| Toggle positional tracking | `Page Up`   | `Ctrl+Shift+G` |
| Toggle yaw mode            | `Page Down` | `Ctrl+Shift+H` |

`Page Up` / `Ctrl+Shift+G` turns positional (6DOF) tracking off and on. Head rotation keeps running either way.

`Toggle yaw mode` switches between world-space (horizon-locked) and camera-local yaw.

The positional tracking choice and the yaw mode are saved to `CameraUnlock.ini` the moment you
change them, so the next launch starts with the same choice. Toggling tracking on or off with `End`
lasts for the session only: each launch starts with tracking on or off as `EnableOnStartup` says.

## Configuration

<!-- cameraunlock:config -->
The mod reads its settings from `reframework\plugins\CameraUnlock.ini` in the game folder, and creates the file when it starts and finds none. Edit it with any text editor.

A setting set to `default` takes its value from `Defaults.ini`, which every head tracking mod that keeps its settings in `CameraUnlock.ini` reads. Head tracking mods that keep their settings in another file do not read it, and neither do earlier versions of this mod. Writing a value in place of `default` changes that setting for this game only. When the mod saves a setting that a hotkey changed in game, it writes the new value in place of `default`, so that setting no longer follows `Defaults.ini` in this game until you set it to `default` again.

`Defaults.ini` is `%AppData%\CameraUnlock\Defaults.ini` on Windows; `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/CameraUnlock/Defaults.ini` on Linux, or `~/.config/CameraUnlock/Defaults.ini` where `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set, under Wine and Proton too; and `~/Library/Application Support/CameraUnlock/Defaults.ini` on macOS. The mod's log, where it writes one, names the file it read.

When the mod starts and finds no `Defaults.ini`, it creates one holding the built-in values, unless Windows runs the game as a packaged app. The mod never changes `Defaults.ini` after that. Edit it with any text editor.

Earlier versions of the mod kept these settings in `HeadTracking.ini`, in the same folder. The first time this version starts and finds no `CameraUnlock.ini`, it reads your settings from `HeadTracking.ini` and writes them into `CameraUnlock.ini`. It never changes `HeadTracking.ini`, and does not read it again while `CameraUnlock.ini` exists.

A setting that the defaults below set to `default` is written as `default` when the value imported for it equals its default at that start, which is the value `Defaults.ini` gives it, or the built-in value where `Defaults.ini` gives none. It then follows `Defaults.ini`. Every other setting is written with the value imported for it.

Comments, and keys the mod never read, are not carried over. Nor are these, where your old file had them:

- Reticle settings, and a key that toggled the reticle.
- A sensitivity, scale, deadzone, response curve or axis inversion you changed from its default. Set these in your tracker instead.
- The setting for a feature that earlier versions shipped switched off while it was untested. It now follows the mod's default.

An older version of the mod reads `HeadTracking.ini` and never reads `CameraUnlock.ini`, so a setting you change after updating is not in `HeadTracking.ini`.

Deleting only `CameraUnlock.ini` makes the next start read `HeadTracking.ini` again. To go back to the defaults, replace everything in `CameraUnlock.ini` with the defaults below. Every setting they set to `default` then follows `Defaults.ini`.

The built-in value of each setting set to `default` below:

- `UdpPort=4242`
- `EnableOnStartup=true`
- `WorldSpaceYaw=true`
- `LocalSmoothing=0.0`
- `RemoteSmoothing=0.15`
- `PositionEnabled=true`
- `PositionLimitX=0.3`
- `PositionLimitY=0.2`
- `PositionLimitZ=0.4`
- `PositionLimitZBack=0.1`
- `ToggleKey=End, Ctrl+Shift+Y`
- `CycleTrackingModeKey=PageUp, Ctrl+Shift+G`
- `YawModeKey=PageDown, Ctrl+Shift+H`

With every setting at its default, the file reads:

```ini
; Resident Evil 3 head tracking settings.
; Comments start with ; and go on their own line. Text after a value is part of the value.
; Hotkeys are key names such as End, PageUp or Ctrl+Shift+Y. Separate several with commas; leave empty for none.
; A setting set to default takes its value from Defaults.ini, which every head tracking mod
; that keeps its settings in CameraUnlock.ini reads: %AppData%\CameraUnlock\Defaults.ini on
; Windows, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/CameraUnlock/Defaults.ini (normally ~/.config/CameraUnlock) on
; Linux, under Wine and Proton too, and ~/Library/Application Support/CameraUnlock/Defaults.ini
; on macOS. The log names the file it read. Write a value instead of default to change that
; setting for this game only.

```
<!-- /cameraunlock:config -->

The mod has no sensitivity, deadzone or axis inversion settings: set those in your tracker. It
moves the view twice as far as the position your tracker reports, up to the position limits
above. That is the `SensitivityX/Y/Z=2.0` earlier builds shipped, now part of the mod.

## Troubleshooting

**Sending a log:**
- REFramework writes one log per game launch at `<game>/re2_framework_log.txt`. That generic name is used for every RE Engine title, so it is the right file for this game too. If the game folder is not writable it lands in `%APPDATA%\REFramework\<exe name>\` instead.
- The file is truncated on every launch, so it only ever holds the current session. Attach it as-is to a bug report.
- This mod's lines are prefixed `[RE3HT]`. The startup sequence to look for is: `Plugin loaded`, `Config Canonical: ...` (`Created` or `Migrated` on the first start of this version), `UDP receiver started on port ...`, `Initialization complete`, then `First tracker pose received: ...` once the tracker sends anything.

**Mod not loading:**
- Ensure REFramework is installed (`dinput8.dll` in game root)
- Check `reframework/` folder exists with `plugins/RE3HeadTracking.dll` inside
- Try running the game as administrator once

**No tracking response:**
- Verify OpenTrack is running and outputting data
- Check UDP port matches (default 4242)
- Press **End** to enable tracking
- If the view sits off to one side, centre it in your tracker app. The mod has no centre of its own
- Check firewall isn't blocking UDP port 4242

**Jitter:**
- Increase `RemoteSmoothing` (phone or other network tracker) or `LocalSmoothing` (tracker on this PC) in the `[Smoothing]` section of `CameraUnlock.ini`
- If using a phone app over WiFi, some jitter is expected. The built-in interpolation helps.

**Wrong rotation axis:**
- Set axis inversion and sensitivity in your tracker app. The mod has no settings for them.

**Yaw feels wrong when looking up or down at extreme angles:**
- Try toggling between world-locked and camera-local yaw with `Page Down`. World-locked (default) is horizon-stable; camera-local follows the camera's current up-axis.

## Updating

Download the new release and run `install.cmd` again. Your config is preserved.

## Uninstalling

Run `uninstall.cmd` from the release folder. This removes the mod DLLs and leaves `CameraUnlock.ini` and `HeadTracking.ini` in place, so a reinstall keeps your settings. REFramework is only removed if it was originally installed by this mod. To force-remove REFramework:

```
uninstall.cmd /force
```
